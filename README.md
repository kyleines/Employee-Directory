# Employee Directory

### Welcome to my Employee Directory for the Team Treehouse: FSJS Techdegree - Unit 5 Project.

Upon page load, a list of twelve random employees will be generated using an API request to [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/). \
Selecting an employee opens a modal window with more details about that person. \
Users can filter the list by using the Searchbar feature, making finding co-workers faster and easier.

This apps's features include: \
:heavy_check_mark: Real-time filtering on keyup in the searchbar. \
:heavy_check_mark: Modal window toggle buttons to easily switch between employees.

Thanks for visiting! \
Feedback, follows, and stars are all appreciated!
